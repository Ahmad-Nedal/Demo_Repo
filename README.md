# Image Recognition with Deep Learning

Deep learning has improved image recognition systems which can be applied in every aspect of our lives. In this project, I will build a DNN to recognize certain objects in some photo. adjust state of the art DNN's for recognition of other new-objects but we don't need to do training again.

1. numpy  

2. pip>=9.0.0 

3. pandas 

4. matplotlib
