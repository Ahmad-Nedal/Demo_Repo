# Abstract:
Deep learning has significantly improved image recognition systems which can be applied in every aspect of our lives. In this project, I will build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to recognize certain objects in some photo using CIFAR-10 dataset to predict one of ten classes of objects. adjust state of the art DNN for recognition of other new-objects but we don't need to do training again.
